This is a **Flutter** app I'm working on to practice and play around with **Solidity**.  
Flutter ðŸ’– the **Ethereum Virtual Machine** :)  

## Features:
1. Create and store tasks in a **smart contract** and display them in a ListView âœ… done
3. **Send** an ERC-721 task from your address **to another address**
4. Receive a **push notification** on device when task is completed
5. Programmatically **trade** some **ETH** in your wallet for a completed task
